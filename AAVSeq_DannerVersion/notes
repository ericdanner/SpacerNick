Install the AAVseq_env.yml enviroment.

This was built off of functions from the Uditas software that was developed for multiple things and so contains extra functions that are not called. It was most recently used
for a guide-seq like work flow. It nearlly identically follows my guide-seq workflow, except it looks for on-target priming on the AAV- ITRs.
